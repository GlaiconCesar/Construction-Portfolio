  "overview": {
    "title": "Project Overview",
    "body": "Salon Privé was delivered as a premium hospitality-style environment inside a temporary event venue. The construction approach required fast assembly, dimensional control, and detailing that could support high-end finishes while remaining compatible with trade show logistics and teardown requirements."
  },
  "scope": {
    "title": "Scope of Work (My Contribution)",
    "items": [
      "Supported layout and assembly of light-gauge steel framing for perimeter walls and upper structure.",
      "Assisted with base platform preparation using plywood for stability and finish support.",
      "Contributed to curved front feature framing, including segmented/cut track setup and stud spacing adjustments.",
      "Coordinated framing interfaces with finishing and millwork teams to keep handoff clean and on schedule."

  "structure": {
    "title": "Structural System Breakdown",
    "base": {
      "title": "Base Platform",
      "body": "The platform used plywood as the primary substrate, selected for rigidity, fastening reliability, and tolerance control across high-traffic zones. It provided a stable base for wall lines, furniture integration, and final finish interfaces."

    "wall": {
      "title": "Wall & Upper Framing",
      "body": "Walls and overhead structure were framed with light-gauge steel studs, supporting both straight and curved conditions. This system balanced speed, repeatability, and clean geometry for architectural finishes."

  "curve": {
    "title": "Curved Front Feature - Technical Execution",
    "steps": [
      "Segmented track (kerf-style cuts) was laid out to define the front radius accurately.",
      "Stud spacing was tightened along the curve to maintain shape control and reduce flat spotting.",
      "Local reinforcement was added where load transfer and edge stability were required.",
      "A 1/4\" (6 mm) raw MDF skin was installed over the framed arc to create a smooth continuous surface ready for finish prep."
    ]
  },
  "mdf": {
    "title": "Material Selection - Why 1/4\" Raw MDF?",
    "items": [
      "Thin MDF bends more predictably over curved framing than thicker boards, improving contour continuity.",
      "Raw MDF supports precise shaping and clean joint transitions in premium interior applications.",
      "Best practice: raw MDF is absorbent and should be sealed/primed properly before final finishing to control porosity and protect surface quality."
    ]
  },
  "finish": {
    "title": "Surface Preparation & Finishing Coordination",
    "body": "Before final finishes, surfaces were aligned, fastener points treated, and transitions reviewed with finishing and millwork teams. Coordination focused on maintaining design intent, reducing rework risk, and meeting quality expectations under event deadlines."
